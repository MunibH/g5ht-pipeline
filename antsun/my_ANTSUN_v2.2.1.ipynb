    "This pipeline takes as input `.nd2` files from the confocal scope corresponding to freely-moving and immobilized recordings for NeuroPAL, together with an `.h5` file from the NIR tracking camera. It processes the confocal data to locate and track neurons in the worm's head, and thereby generates GCaMP traces for these neurons. It also generates the NeuroPAL RGB image used for labeling, labels it with AutoCellLabeler, and maps the labels back to the freely-moving traces. It also processes the NIR data to extract behavioral variables that can be correlated with the calcium traces.\n",

    "### GPU acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "Many steps of `ANTSUN` are GPU-accelerated (they are labeled as such beforehand). Thus, you need to ensure that there is sufficient GPU memory on your device before running those steps. It is recommended to have at least 8GB available before running any GPU-accelerated step. You can view how much GPU memory is available by running `nvidia-smi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On `flv-c1`, there is only one GPU with 8GB memory. ANTSUN will likely fail as this is not enough memory.\n",
    "- On `flv-c2`, there are four GPUs, two with 16GB memory each and two with 24GB each.\n",
    "- On `flv-c3`, there are four GPUs, three with 24GB memory each and one with 48GB.\n",
    "- On `flv-c4`, there are four GPUs, each with 48GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using a server with more than one GPU, you can specify which one to use (according to its index in `nvidia-smi` by setting `nvidia_smi_device` and `flv_c` appropriately). Please reserve the GPU using our [GPU reservations sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wMQ_bGJly15_1CXspK0fWzs-bd-lF-tVMpOVZZZ6SAc/edit?gid=922051617#gid=922051617).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please restart the kernel after the notebook is done running.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "If a step of the pipeline encounters an unexpected error, it is usually advisable to restart the kernel. **WARNING:** Restarting the kernel while save operations are in progress could corrupt the data files and possibly mean you would have to start over from the very beginning. Thus, before restarting the kernel, you should check that `JLD2` files are not actively being saved, and only restart the kernel once the pipeline is on a step other than saving them.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you restart the kernel, rerun the \"Load packages\", \"Data parameters\" and \"Initialize data dictionaries\" steps of the pipeline. This should reset the pipeline into its last usable state. If the error was due to running out of memory or some other hardware issue, assuming there are computing resources available, you should then be able to run the pipeline from the step that generated the error through the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the error was due to you making a mistake in the \"Data parameters\" section of the pipeline, you may need to rerun the \"Pipeline parameters\" and \"Save parameter settings\" sections of the notebook after running the \"Initialize data dictionaries\" step, but note that you should **not** rerun the \"Read meta-parameters from the ND2 file\" step."
