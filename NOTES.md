- there's nothing in the .nd2 file metadata that indicates number of z-slices per frame
    - should be able to get that automatically from somewhere? 
        - doesn't seem to be saved anywhere
        - 41 slices per frame
        - 0.36 um for each timepoint
- even though we focus in the middle of the worm, the recording starts at the bottom most z-coordinate and moves up 41 slices, then resets, and repeats per frame stack
- last 2 z-slices are trimmed?
